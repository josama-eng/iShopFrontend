          <p>
            The iPhone Xs and iPhone XS Max use the new A12 Bionic chip. Both
            phones have a 6-core CPU and a 4-core GPU, both of which are faster
            and more powerful than iPhone X from last year.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-3xl py-5">The Camera</h3>
          <p>
            The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max both come with a dual camera system
            on the back that consists of an f1.8 12MP wide-angle lens and an
            f2.4 12MP telephoto lens.

          <p>
            The video capabilities are the same as the last year's iPhone X,
            meaning you can expect the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max to have the
            following video specs:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pt-2">
            <li>4K video recording at 24 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps</li>
            <li>1080p HD video recording at 30 fps or 60 fps</li>
            <li>720p HD video recording at 30 fps</li>
            <li>Optical image stabilization for video</li>
            <li>Sloâ€‘mo video support for 1080p at 120 fps or 240 fps</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
